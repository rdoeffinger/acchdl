\chapter{The Software Interface}
For accessing the hardware a simple C library interface is provided.
\Fref{lst:efacexample} is a small example program showing the basic
use of this library, derived from one of the test programs for the design.

\section{Available Functions}
\section{Optimization Tricks}
This section will explain some of the very specific tricks used in
order to generate faster and smaller code to access the device.
They are not very useful yet, since the speed of the device itself
is the major limit and no software optimizations help (though smaller
code always means less cache pressure).
Still these details may be interesting to some and should help
understand the code.\\
The following explanations assume at least basic knowledge of x86
assembler and how application linking and operating systems work.\\
For a reference of x86 assembler instructions refer to e.g. AMD's
Programmer's Manuals~\cite{amdinstr}.\\
To demonstrate these various tricks, the code in~\fref{lst:demo}
is compiled in several different ways.\\
All tests were done with "gcc (GCC) 4.1.2 (Ubuntu 4.1.2-0ubuntu4)",
and unless indicate otherwise were build for the x86\_64 architecture.\\
In these examples, the device address range is assumed to be marked
uncacheable which might not be the best option for optimal speed but
simplifies the code for demonstration --- the difference is just a
missing instruction like clflush or mfence.\\


\begin{lstlisting}[float=ht,caption=compilation demonstration code,label=lst:demo]
#include "libefac.h"
void test(void) {
  efac_add4(0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0);
}
\end{lstlisting}

The C library during efac\_init maps the physical address space of the
device into the application's address space. This is done via mmap,
and usually the choice of virtual address is left to mmap and the
resulting address stored in a variable.\\
This leads to assembler code as in~\fref{lst:regptr}. efac\_regs
here is a pointer variable (declared as "uint32\_t *efac\_regs").
The contents of this pointer variable as a first step must be loaded
into a register.\\
If now efac\_regs is instead declared as an array
("uint32\_t efac\_regs[REGISTER\_SIZE]") and the device simply mapped
"over" it, the address is already known at link time and can be hard-code,
as~\fref{lst:inline64} shows. Note that this trick may fail if compiling
a dynamic library (more precisely if generating position-independent code).\\

\begin{lstlisting}[float=ht,caption={x86\_64 using register pointer (gcc -S -m64 -O3)},label={lst:regptr}]
test:
        movq    efac_regs(%rip), %rdx
        movl    $0x3f800000, %eax
        movl    %eax, 64(%rdx)
        movl    %eax, 68(%rdx)
        movl    %eax, 72(%rdx)
        movl    %eax, 76(%rdx)
        ret
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[float=ht,caption={x86\_64 inlined (gcc -S -m64 -O3)},label={lst:inline64}]
test:
        movl    $0x3f800000, %eax
        movl    %eax, efac_regs+64(%rip)
        movl    %eax, efac_regs+68(%rip)
        movl    %eax, efac_regs+72(%rip)
        movl    %eax, efac_regs+76(%rip)
        ret
\end{lstlisting}

Another optimization is that except for initialization most of the code is
in the header file, so that the functions can be inlined. The benefit is
not only that the function call overhead is saved, but also expressions
based on constant function arguments can be calculated at compile-time
instead of runtime.\\
In \fref{lst:noinline64} the address must be calculated at runtime,
whereas due to inlining the can be calculated at compile-time in
\fref{lst:inline64}. Of course this pre-calculation is only possible
if the register number is a constant, but this should be the much
more common case --- on most CPU architectures the register number
is coded into the instruction at compile-time as well.\\
Note that the effect of inlining is even more pronounced when compiling
for 32 bit x86 architecture, as a comparison between \fref{lst:inline32}
and \fref{lst:noinline32} shows. This is because the 32 bit ABI passes
all arguments via the stack, which means the function needs a stack
frame and the data must be loaded from stack into a register before
it can be written again to the device.\\
