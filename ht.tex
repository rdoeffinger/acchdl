\chapter{Basic HyperTransport Concepts}

To ease understanding of some of the implementation approaches, I will describe
some of the basics of HyperTransport and some of the details that are not easy
find elsewhere.\\
For more details and precise descriptions, please refer to the HyperTransport
specification~\cite{htspec}.\\
HyperTransport is a high-speed device interconnect, used in particular by AMD CPUs.
A HyperTransport link always connects exactly two devices, which means reduced
management overhead compared to and ordinary bus, while still allowing to connect many
devices by allowing chaining of links, tunnels and bridges.\\
An optional part of the specification also allows for more complex HyperTransport
networks with more advanced routing.\\
On the physical level, HyperTransport uses differential signalling and independent links
for each communication direction.\\
Link speed can be varied independently in each direction as well, allowing any combination
of link frequencies from 200 to 2600 MHz (DDR) and link widths of 2 bits to 32 bits (requiring
29 to 199 pins respectively~\cite{htarch}).\\
Each link also uses 3 independent virtual channels (i.e. each has their own buffers so
they can not block each other): posted, nonposted and response.\\
Flow control is done using a credit-based system: each virtual channel has an
associated number of credits on the sender side (representing available buffers on
the receiver side), independent for command and data.\\
Sending a command/data reduces the number of credits on the sender side,
the receiver increases them again by sending appropriate nop command packets
(nops do not use credits, thus no deadlocks are possible).\\
For data, each data packet uses one credit (size can vary between 4 and 64 bytes).
There is an optional data credit mode where each 4 bytes of data use up one
credit, but this is not available in the implementation used.\\
The implementation used provides 32 credits for each virtual channel, for both
command and data.\\
HyperTransport devices are configured (e.g. base address) by a set of registers
with same layout and behaviour as PCI configuration registers, so it is easily
possible to use a HyperTransport device just like a PCI device, just with a much
faster and lower latency connection.\\




Credits for commands are restored to the sender automatically when they are
read from the fifo, whereas for data (since it can have varying size) an
explicit data\_complete signal must be used.\\
Since correct handling of this signal increases complexity significantly
and wrong handling can result in the CPU hanging, this together with some
additional simplifications is handled separately in the ht\_simplify module.
