Interface of the Accumulator VHDL Entity
Basic input signals:
    clock: sensitive to rising edge.
    reset: set to 1 for an (asynchronous) reset.

Control input signals:
    sign: set to 1 for subtraction instead of addition (flip sign).
    op: operation to execute. Use one of the op_ constants.
    data_in: data to operate on.
    pos: block position as signed value needed for some operations.

Output signals:
    ready: if 1 indicates that the operation given by the control input signals
        is now being processed and the control input signals should be set to
        the right values for the next operation.
        Use op_nop if you do not have any next operation to execute (yet).
        The input signals may be changed at any time, not only when ready
        is 1, any value when ready was not 1 will be ignored.
    data_out: result data after any read operation. This will be valid the
        cycle after the ready signal becomes 1 to indicate the start of
        processing for the operation following the read.

Operations of the Accumulator VHDL Entity

op_nop: no operation
op_add: add/subtract (depending on sign signal) a 64 bit block
    (representing a positive integer) at the 32 bit block offset
    specified by the pos signal.
op_readblock: read 32 bit block specified by the pos signal, reads
    below the actually RAM-backed memory range return 0,
    reads above 0 for positive, X"FFFFFFFF" for negative values.
op_writeblock: write 32 bit block specified by the pos signal, writes outside
    the implemented range are ignored (ideally they should set overflow/
    underflow flags as appropriate).
op_readflags: read virtual 32 bit flag register. The upper 16 bits indicate
    which of the lower 16 bits (the actual flags) are valid.
    Meaning of the flags:
    Bit 0: sign
    Bit 1: overflow
    Bit 2: zero
op_writeflags: set the flags marked by a set bit in the upper 16 bits to
    the value in the lower 16 bits.
    This is mostly for allowing to restore the register state from system
    RAM and not useful otherwise.
    Meaning of the bit values:
    Bit 0: sign (only the sign is set, the value stored in the RAM is not
           changed. There is probably no practical use for this).
    Bit 1: overflow. Periodically checking and clearing the overflow flag
           can be used to detect ranges of summands that contain Inf or NaN
           and may need additional, more careful processing later.
    Bit 2: zero. Setting to 0 has no effect, setting to 1 clears the register
           (bits 0 and 1 should be set to 0 at the same time preferably).
op_readoffsets:
    get exponent offsets for floating point operations.
    Exponent offsets are two 16 bit signed integers.
    Lower 16 bits are for writes (op_floatadd) higher 16 bits for reads (op_readfloat).
op_writeoffsets:
    set exponent offsets for floating point operations.
    Exponent offsets are two 16 bit signed integers.
    Lower 16 bits are for writes (op_floatadd) higher 16 bits for reads (op_readfloat).
op_readfloat: reads the current register content as a single-precision
    floating-point value. Denormals and +/-Inf are supported, values that should
    be NaN are returned as +/-Inf.
    The pos signal is misused to specify the rounding mode:
    0: round to zero
    1: round away from zero
    2: round to -infinity
    3: round to infinity
    4: round to nearest
    other values are unspecified.
op_floatadd: adds/subtracts (depending on sign signal) the given
    single-precision floating-point value. Note that NaN is treated as Inf
    currently.

Steps of the op_floatadd Operation

 0) Handle Inf/NaN special cases by setting the overflow bit
 1) combine sign of value with sign signal
 2) extract 32 bit block position and shift value from exponent
 3) extract mantissa (with leading 1 or 0 depending on denormal or not)
 4) shift mantissa for alignment with 32 bit block boundary
 5) load first 32 bit block
 6) add/subtract lower part of mantissa to block value
 7) store first 32 bit block
 8) load second 32 bit block
 9) add/subtract upper part of mantissa and carry to block value
10) store second 32 bit block
==== following steps are only necessary if carry is set,
==== but currently they are done always to simplify the implementation     
11) calculate carry resolution position
12) flip bits in-between current position and carry-resolution position
===============
13a) load 32 bit block for carry resolution
14a) add/subtract carry
15a) store 32 bit block for carry resolution
===============
13b) flip sign bit as part of carry resolution
===============
13c) set overflow bit as part of carry "resolution"

These steps are organized into clock cycles as follows:
Clock 1: 0) - 3)
Clock 2: 4), 5)
Clock 3: 6), 8), 11), pre-calculate 12)
Clock 4: 7), 9), 13a)
Clock 5: 10), 12), 14a), 13b), 13c)
Clock 6: 15a)

Note that processing of the next operation starts with Clock 5, so in
each 4 cycles one floatadd operation can complete.
Reducing the number of clock cycles is difficult for several reasons:
1) Skipping carry resolution if there is no carry is probably easiest, but
   will increase code complexity since the carry value is only known after
   Clock 4, but to gain anything processing of the next instruction would
   have to start _at_ Clock 4.
2) The dual-port BlockRAM resource can not service more read-write requests
   than the current implementation uses, thus any improvements either need
   to use multiple BlockRAMs (which in a previous implementation resulted in
   low clock speeds) or a RAM resource with more than 2 ports.
3) Pipelining will need difficult dependency resolution, since the 32 bit blocks
   that are changed only become known for certain in step 12, though for the
   general case a worst-case guess based on the pre-calculated value for step
   12) may be good enough.

Steps of the op_readfloat Operation

 1) Determine block number of highest set bit (highest bit not equal to sign),
    or the number of the block containing the lowest bit representable by a
    denormal if this is higher.
 2) read block determined in step 1 and the one below.
 3) determine position of first set/unset bit in read block.
 4) calculate exponent value with information from step 1) and 3).
 5) use value from step 3) to shift the blocks read in 2) so that the highest
    bit unequal to the sign is "leftmost".
 6) determine which is the lowest block that is not all 0.
 7) use results of steps 5) and 6) to check if the value can be represented
    exactly as float (special case for denormals, needs exponent from step 4).
 8) for negative values now invert the value from 5) (together with rounding
    converts two's complement to absolute value for mantissa).
 9) apply rounding if necessary (needs result from step 7 to avoid bias).
10) adjust exponent for possible carry due to rounding.
11) use sign, exponent from 10) and mantissa from 9) to build the float value.
    Needs special-case for denormals and infinities.

These steps are organized into clock cycles as follows:
Clock 1: wait, since this could overlap with write-back from previous operation
Clock 2: 1)
Clock 3: 2), 6)
Clock 4: 2), 3)
Clock 5: 4)
Clock 6: 4), 5), 7), 8)
Clock 7: 9), 10), 11)
