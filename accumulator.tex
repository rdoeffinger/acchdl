    specified by the pos signal.}
\tabline {op\_readblock} {
    read 32 bit block specified by the pos signal, reads

\tabline {op\_writeblock} {
    write 32 bit block specified by the pos signal, writes outside
    the implemented range are ignored (ideally they should set overflow/

    read virtual 32 bit flag register. The upper 16 bits indicate
    which of the lower 16 bits (the actual flags) are valid.}
\tabline {op\_writeflags} {
    set the flags marked by a set bit in the upper 16 bits to
    the value in the lower 16 bits.
    This is mostly for allowing to restore the register state from system
    RAM and rarely useful otherwise.}
\tabline {op\_readoffsets} {
    get exponent offsets for floating point operations.
    Exponent offsets are two 16 bit signed integers.
    Lower 16 bits are for writes (op\_floatadd) higher 16 bits for reads (op\_readfloat).}
\tabline {op\_writeoffsets} {
    set exponent offsets for floating point operations.
    Exponent offsets are two 16 bit signed integers.

\tabline {op\_readfloat} {
    reads the current register content as a single-precision
    floating-point value. Denormals and +/-Inf are supported, values that should
    be NaN are returned as +/-Inf.
    The pos signal is misused to specify the rounding mode, see~\fref{tab:round}.}
\tabline {op\_floatadd} {
    adds/subtracts (depending on sign signal) the given

These steps are organized into clock cycles as follows:
Clock 1: 0) - 3)
Clock 2: 4), 5)
Clock 3: 6), 8), 11), pre-calculate 12)
Clock 4: 7), 9), 13a)
Clock 5: 10), 12), 14a), 13b), 13c)
Clock 6: 15a)

Note that processing of the next operation starts with Clock 5, so in
each 4 cycles one floatadd operation can complete.
Reducing the number of clock cycles is difficult for several reasons:
1) Skipping carry resolution if there is no carry is probably easiest, but
   will increase code complexity since the carry value is only known after
   Clock 4, but to gain anything processing of the next instruction would
   have to start \em at \rm Clock 4.
2) The dual-port BlockRAM resource can not service more read-write requests
   than the current implementation uses, thus any improvements either need
   to use multiple BlockRAMs (which in a previous implementation resulted in
   low clock speeds) or a RAM resource with more than 2 ports.
3) Pipelining will need difficult dependency resolution, since the 32 bit blocks
   that are changed only become known for certain in step 12, though for the
   general case a worst-case guess based on the pre-calculated value for step
   12) may be good enough.

\subsection{Steps of the op\_readfloat Operation}

 1) Determine block number of highest set bit (highest bit not equal to sign),
    or the number of the block containing the lowest bit representable by a
    denormal if this is higher.
 2) read block determined in step 1 and the one below.
 3) determine position of first set/unset bit in read block.
 4) calculate exponent value with information from step 1) and 3).
 5) use value from step 3) to shift the blocks read in 2) so that the highest
    bit unequal to the sign is "leftmost".
 6) determine which is the lowest block that is not all 0.
 7) use results of steps 5) and 6) to check if the value can be represented
    exactly as float (special case for denormals, needs exponent from step 4).
 8) for negative values now invert the value from 5) (together with rounding
    converts two's complement to absolute value for mantissa).
 9) apply rounding if necessary (needs result from step 7 to avoid bias).
10) adjust exponent for possible carry due to rounding.
11) use sign, exponent from 10) and mantissa from 9) to build the float value.
    Needs special-case for denormals and infinities.

These steps are organized into clock cycles as follows:
Clock 1: wait, since this could overlap with calculation from previous operation
Clock 1a: wait if a write-back from a previous operation is pending
Clock 2: 1)
Clock 3: 2), 6)
Clock 4: 2), 3)
Clock 5: 4)
Clock 6: 4), 5), 7), 8)
Clock 7: 9), 10), 11)

    Meaning of the flags:
    Bit 0: sign
    Bit 1: overflow
    Bit 2: zero

    Meaning of the bit values:
    Bit 0: sign (only the sign is set, the value stored in the RAM is not
           changed. There is probably no practical use for this).
    Bit 1: overflow. Periodically checking and clearing the overflow flag
           can be used to detect ranges of summands that contain Inf or NaN
           and may need additional, more careful processing later.
    Bit 2: zero. Setting to 0 has no effect, setting to 1 clears the register
           (bits 0 and 1 should be set to 0 at the same time preferably).
