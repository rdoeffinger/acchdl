\section{The HyperTransport Core}

The HyperTransport implementation used is the "HT Core" by the Computer
Architecture Group of the University of Mannheim, more specifially the
version 0.9 for 16-bit links from September 2007.\\
This implementation handles HyperTransport data credits in a non-trivial
way, and since its documentation does not explain this clearly, it is
explained here.\\
Credits for commands are restored to the sender automatically when they are
read from the fifo, whereas for data (since it can have varying size) an
explicit data\_complete signal must be used.\\
This signal must be set to high for exactly one cycle each time a data packet
has been completely read. In particular, it must not be set if a command
has no associated data, and it must be set for only one cycle even if reading
all associated data takes multiple cycles, and it must be set after or
exactly when the last data of the packet is shifted out of the FIFO.\\
Since correct handling of this signal increases complexity significantly
and wrong handling can result in the CPU hanging, this together with some
additional simplifications is handled separately in the ht\_simplify module,
described in~\fref{sec:htsimplify}.

\section{The HyperTransport Simplification Layer}
\label{sec:htsimplify}

The HyperTransport simplification layer (the module called ht\_simplify)
merges the posted and non-posted queue into one queue, handles setting
the data\_complete signals of the HyperTransport core, splits multi-dword
writes into multiple writes of a single dword and inserts nop
commands into the queue as necessary, thus eliminating the need for
and extra "empty" signal, and provides a signal that indicates
if the current command must be replied to via the response queue.\\
This greatly reduces the complexity and frustration of designing a device
that uses HyperTransport by handling the parts that are most error-prone
and easily lead to a stopped CPU.\\
In the current implementation it has also several drawbacks: byte-sized
writes are not handled correctly, and the transfer rate is limited to one command
and 32 bits data per clock cycle, whereas the HT Core allows for up to one
command and 64 bits of data per clock cycle per queue.\\
